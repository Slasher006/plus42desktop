WHY IS THERE NO SOURCE CODE FOR THE ANDROID AND IOS VERSIONS HERE?
ISN'T PLUS42 OPEN SOURCE?

While I do want Plus42 to be open source, I am keeping the Android- and
iOS-specific parts of the source code closed for now. I am planning to open
those parts back up again eventually, probably a year after the first official
release.

I'm keeping the Android and iOS parts closed at first, in order to give my
builds a chance to establish themselves, without competition from others who
might take my source code, build executables, and sell them for less. One might
hope that no one would want to do something like that, without even adding any
value, but I've seen it happen before. So, bluntly put, I would like to reap
the rewards, for the countless hours I've spent developing Plus42, without
competition, for a while.

Once I re-open the Android- and iOS-specific parts of the Plus42 source code,
the 'plus42desktop' repository will be removed, and the 'plus42' repository,
containing all versions, not to mention all revisions, all the way back to the
fork from Free42, and the oldest Free42 commits from 2005, will be restored.

Thank you for understanding!

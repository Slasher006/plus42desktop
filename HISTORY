2022-12-14: release 1.0.15

* Fixed a couple of bugs in Paste of scalars in BINM, OCTM, and HEXM modes.
* Fixed pasting of U+22A2 and U+22A6 ('append' characters used by i41CX and
  Emu42) and U+00B7 ('bullet' character used by Emu42).

2022-11-19: release 1.0.14

* Added support for new SI prefixes: R (ronna, 10^27), Q (quetta, 10^30), r
  (ronto, 10^-27), and q (quecto, 10^-30).

2022-11-12: release 1.0.13

* Fixed crash with one-arg RADIUS, ANGLE, XCOORD, and YCOORD.

2022-10-27: release 1.0.12

* SOLVE does a better job of reporting Sign Reversal when a function changes
  sign around a vertical asymptote, instead of reporting it as a root.
* When returning to the equation editor after a parse error, the text could be
  positioned incorrectly on the screen, and the editor could even crash, in
  some cases. Fixed.
* Added Boolean operators to the equation editor's PGM.FCN menu.
* Made I%YR solver a bit more robust.
* BASE: complex numbers and numbers with units were being copied or shown in
  non-decimal bases in some cases.
* Better HEXM and OCTM handling in SHOW.
* Fixed number entry in PRGM mode when BINM/OCTM/HEXM active.
* No longer setting flag 22 if number entry ends with DROP in NSTK mode.
* Added LINE PLOT.M SPFV SPPV TVM USFV USPV to CATALOG->MISC.
* ->PAR now produces more helpful output in TRACE mode.
* Windows, Mac, and Linux versions: added Alt-1 through Alt-6 as mappings for
  the second row of the keyboard.

2022-10-01: release 1.0.11

* Fixed crash in SHOW for certain complex numbers.
* Added A...F function. This allows programs to turn on HEXM mode with the
  A...F menu activated.
* Added UBASE and UVAL to the equation parser.
* PLOT: Fixed coordinate rounding at the top of the display.
* Raised precedence of _ operator, so expressions like 40000_"km"/1_"d" can now
  be written without parentheses.
* The direct solver now converts the solution to match the units of the
  previous value of the variable being solved for, if it existed already and
  had compatible units. In all other cases, the variable is overwritten, as
  before.
* iOS version: Added Calculator / Print-Out swipe direction configuration
  option to Preferences.
* Android, iOS, and MacOS versions: Fixed incorrect Out of Range error returned
  by BASE functions in certain cases, e.g. BRESET 64 WSIZE 1 ENTER BASEÃ·
  The problem is caused by an optimizer bug in the ARM compiler, and does not
  affect the Windows and Linux versions, nor the MacOS version on Intel.

2022-08-13: release 1.0.10

* Fixed crash in PARSE when parsing ITEM().
* Fixed (re,im) complex pasting. This was broken by localized copy & paste.
* Special cases for pure real and pure imaginary in SQRT.

2022-06-19: release 1.0.9

* SGN() didn't evaluate its parameter, and instead consumed the value from
  level 1. Fixed.
  Note that this was a code generator bug; any expressions containing SGN()
  will have to be re-parsed in order to eliminate the effects of this bug.
* SOLVE in PLOT, when used with a function with X:<STK>, would create an
  extraneous variable named "". Fixed.

2022-06-18: release 1.0.8

* I%YR iteration robustness improvements.
* Localized Copy & Paste.
* Fixed handling of invalid number keys in BASE.
* Setting AMORT->TABLE parameters to 1 initially.
* Fixed #P parameter check so it doesn't allow 0.
* iOS and MacOS versions: Fixed skin rendering for iOS 16 and MacOS 13.

2022-06-11: release 1.0.7

* Fixed crash in variable catalog.
* I%YR robustness improvements.

2022-06-08: release 1.0.6

* Fixed I%YR when PMT=0 (broken in 1.0.5)

2022-06-08: release 1.0.5

* TVM: PMT returned incorrect results in BEGIN mode. Fixed.
* TVM: In some cases, I%YR could return inaccurate results because of poor
  starting guesses for the iteration. Fixed.
* More accurate complex ACOS and ACOSH.
* Android version: Now removes itself from the task list if exited using OFF.

2022-05-17: release 1.0.4

* TVM: Fixed error checks in N.

2022-05-13: release 1.0.3

* SOLVE now handles functions that are always positive or always negative a bit
  better, reporting Extremum when the iteration appears to be bouncing around
  without improving, instead of continuing indefinitely.
* PLOT now detects <Not a Number> in XMIN/XMAX/YMIN/YMAX and reports Invalid
  Data, instead of freezing.

2022-05-09: release 1.0.2

* Added code to prevent freeze in PLOT under certain circumstances.

2022-05-09: release 1.0.1a (Android only)

* Fix for crash on startup with Android versions before 4.3.

2022-05-05: release 1.0.1

* DIM "X", when X existed but was not a matrix, would cause a crash. Fixed.
* Equations: NOT was broken, not recognized as Boolean operator. Fixed.
* Equations: Added TYPE? and UNIT? functions.

2022-05-05: release 1.0a (Windows and Linux)

* More efficient display updating, so long-running programs that update the
  display a lot don't waste a lot of CPU time repainting the display faster
  than the human eye can see, and spend more time actually running the program
  instead. Note that this update is for Windows and Linux only, because the
  Android, iOS, and MacOS versions already worked this way.

2022-04-27: release 1.0

* Based on Free42 3.0.11, with the addition of: a larger and resizable display,
  algebraic equations, attached units, directories, time value of money and
  amortization schedules, and function plotting.

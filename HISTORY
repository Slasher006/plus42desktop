2022-05-05: release 1.0a (Windows and Linux)

* More efficient display updating, so long-running programs that update the
  display a lot don't waste a lot of CPU time repainting the display faster
  than the human eye can see, and spend more time actually running the program
  instead. Note that this update is for Windows and Linux only, because the
  Android, iOS, and MacOS versions already worked this way.

2022-04-27: release 1.0

* Based on Free42 3.0.11, with the addition of: a larger and resizable display,
  algebraic equations, attached units, directories, time value of money and
  amortization schedules, and function plotting.
